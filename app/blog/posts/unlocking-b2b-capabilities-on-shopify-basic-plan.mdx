## Introduction

Shopify's Basic Plan is primarily designed for direct-to-consumer (D2C) sales, offering a range of features suitable for small to medium-sized businesses. However, businesses aiming to engage in business-to-business (B2B) transactions may find the native B2B features exclusive to Shopify Plus. This article explores methods to incorporate fundamental B2B functionalities within the constraints of the Basic Plan.

## Understanding Shopify's B2B Limitations on the Basic Plan

Shopify's native B2B features are available exclusively on the Shopify Plus plan. According to Shopify's documentation:

> **B2B on Shopify is available only to stores on the Shopify Plus plan. For information about Shopify Plus plan pricing, contact us.**

Therefore, certain advanced B2B functionalities, such as customer-specific pricing, bulk order management, and customized checkout experiences, are not natively supported on the Basic Plan. However, there are alternative approaches to implement essential B2B features.

## Implementing B2B Features on the Basic Plan

### 1. Utilizing Third-Party Apps

While Shopify's Basic Plan does not offer built-in B2B features, third-party apps can bridge this gap. For instance, the "Lock & Hide Price" app allows merchants to restrict product pricing visibility and purchasing capabilities to registered customers only. This ensures that only authorized business clients can access wholesale pricing and place orders. A user from the Shopify Community suggests:

> **The Shopify Basic plan by default doesn't have an option for hiding prices and add to cart button with B2C customers. But it's possible to do so without upgrading to Shopify Plus by using third-party apps. You can use the [Login/Lock & Hide Price](https://apps.shopify.com/login-to-access-pages) app.**

By implementing such apps, merchants can effectively create a B2B storefront that caters to their wholesale customers' needs.

### 2. Customizing Customer Accounts

Enhancing the customer account experience can significantly improve B2B operations. By customizing customer accounts, businesses can provide a personalized purchasing experience for their clients. This includes allowing customers to manage their accounts, edit shipping information, place reorders, view order history, and submit returns. Shopify's documentation highlights:

> **Allow B2B customers to log in using customer accounts to access B2B specific information, such as products and pricing. This ensures that only authorized customers can access wholesale offerings. [>](https://help.shopify.com/en/manual/b2b/customer-login-and-accounts)**

While some advanced features may be limited on the Basic Plan, focusing on enhancing customer account functionalities can provide a more tailored and efficient B2B experience.

### 3. Implementing Manual Order Management

For businesses that primarily handle B2B transactions, manual order management can be an effective solution. This involves creating custom order forms, setting up minimum order quantities, and offering personalized discounts. By manually processing orders, businesses can maintain control over the ordering process and cater to the specific needs of their B2B customers. Additionally, integrating with external systems for inventory and order management can streamline operations and improve efficiency.

## Conclusion

While Shopify's Basic Plan does not offer native B2B features, businesses can leverage third-party apps, customize customer accounts, and implement manual order management to create a functional B2B environment. These solutions enable merchants to provide tailored experiences for their wholesale customers without the need to upgrade to Shopify Plus. As your business grows, you may consider transitioning to a plan that offers more advanced B2B functionalities to further enhance your operations.
